- bottom-up, makefile style build targets
  - fast builds, skip duplicate tasks!
- pipeline style builds, easy to understand
- standalone executable means build automation for _any_ language or project
  - stop using make and bash--use a modern syntax and a real scripting language
- great UX is priority 1
