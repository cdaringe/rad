# rad ðŸ’¯

a general purpose build tool.

## usage

`$ rad <task-name> [--help]`

```ts
// rad.ts - your buildfile
const format = `prettier --write`
const test = `deno test src/test.ts`
const build = {
  dependsOn: [format],
  fn({ sh }) => sh('tsc')
}
export const tasks = {
  build,
  format,
  test
}
```

## install

see our `releases` section

## what is it

- bottom-up, `make`-style build targets
  - fast builds, skip redundant tasks when inputs haven't changed!
- pipeline style builds
  - easy to understand, declarative build steps
- highly portable. build automation for _any_ language or project, in many environments
- generic package management
- great UX is priority 1 (after priorities 0.33 works, 0.66 correct, & 0.99 fast-enough :))

## why

no build tools in ~2018~ ~2019~ 2020 have a complete feature set that the average polyglot programmer needs without coercing it or piling on extraneous complexity.

see [why not just use <my-favorite-build-tool>](./why-not.md)

## features

- stop using `make` and `bash`.  use a modern syntax and a real scripting language
  - `<ref to why bash is not fit for general purpose scripting>`
- no DSL. your **build is code**--tasks are POJOs with a verified interface
- debuggable. :bug: halt the runtime, inspect your data, tasks, or even _rad_ itself
- beautiful.
- take it anywhere.
  - osx, linux, windows!
    - help us support other architectures
- no dependencies.
  - e.g. you don't need bash, or java, this lib, that lib, etc.  we bundle everything we need,
courtesy of `deno bundle`!
